<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a 5-year PhD student (PhD candidate) at University of California, Los Angeles, Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences. I work with my advisors (Lingsen Meng, Chen Ji, and Jean-Paul Ampuero) on exploring global devastating earthquakes.

I graduated from School of Earth Sciences, Zhejiang University with a bachelor‚Äôs degree.
 
My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
