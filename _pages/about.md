I am currently a 5th-year PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences. My research focuses on understanding global devastating earthquakes. I utilize multi-geophysical data and advanced modeling techniques to explore earthquake mechanisms, rupture propagation, fault unzipping, and their associated hazards. My work spans both continental and oceanic earthquakes, covering continental faults, subduction zones, and oceanic transform boundaries.

A key finding from my research is that many large continental and oceanic earthquakes rupture faults faster than the shear wave speeds of rock materials‚Äîan occurrence known as **supershear earthquakes**. I have also demonstrated that **fault asperities**, the stronger sections of a fault, play a crucial role during the pre- and co-seismic stages, significantly influencing rupture arrest and propagation.

Currently, my research focuses on two main areas:

1. Advancing observational techniques for global earthquakes: I developed a "core phase Back-Projection" method that utilizes seismic waves traveling through Earth's core to improve the imaging of earthquake rupture propagation on a global scale.
2. Bridging the gap between natural earthquake observations and numerical/dynamic simulations: My interdisciplinary approach integrates seismic observations with cutting-edge simulations, providing new insights into supershear rupture dynamics.

<br/>
During the 2024 Mw 7.5 Noto earthquake in Japan, we found notable complexity in the early stage of the rupture. A strong fault asperity, which remained unbroken in preceding seismic swarms, slowed down the rupture in the first 10 s. Then, a second rupture initiated at the opposite edge of the asperity at 12 s, and the asperity succumbed to double-pincer rupture fronts during 12-20 s. The failure of this high-stress drop asperity drove the earthquake into a large-scale event. Interestingly, we observed a lack of swarm seismicity before 2024 within the asperity, indicating that its behavior as a fault barrier was already apparent during the preceding swarm. Our observations help unravel the crucial role of fault asperities in controlling swarm migration and rupture propagation and underscore the need for detailed seismological and interdisciplinary studies to assess seismic risk in swarm-prone regions. See [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp0493) for more details.

- **Global frequency of oceanic and continental supershear earthquakes**

<br/>
Earthquakes are supershear when their rupture speed is faster than the shear wave speed. These events are rare but highly destructive owing to the associated strong ground shaking. Only a few supershear earthquakes have been reported previously, most of which were continental. We performed a systematic global search for supershear earthquakes by analysing seismic data from all large shallow strike-slip earthquakes occurring between 2000 and 2020. We found that at least 14.0% of large earthquakes during the study period were supershear, with oceanic events occurring as frequently as continental ones. The transition to and propagation of supershear earthquakes may be promoted in oceanic settings due to the thicker crustal seismogenic zones and the material contrast at oceanic‚Äìcontinental boundaries.
